# DataAnalysis-OilDemand
 
The attached excel file `Practical Scenario Assessment.xlsx` has an 'Instructions' tab as well as a 'Summary' tab of what the two expected output files should look like (output.csv and output2.csv). The test is intended to create a Python Notebook to produce the two output files. 

My Notebook is [here](https://github.com/manuzrpEd/DataAnalysis-OilDemand/blob/main/DataAnalysis-OilDemand.ipynb).

# Instructions

### Input data ###

1. Input data are in the sheets marked as green:
  *  You are provided with data of sales, population, miles driven, fuel economy/efficiency of different car types: battery electric vehicles (BEVs), hybrid vehicles, conventional gasoline cars, and macroeconomic data like population by age group, GDP through to 2040.
2. Conversion factors are provided in the "Conversion factors" tab, marked as yellow.

### Output data ###

Complete the tables in the Summary (TBC) tab marked as blue.

### Modelling/Method ###

1. Total oil demand in the road sector = Gasoline demand + Diesel demand + LPG demand.
2. Gasoline Demand (GD) Diesel demand (DD) and LPG demand (LD) are calculated as follows:
 *  Gasoline (Vehicle population) * Gasoline (Miles Travelled) * Gasoline (Fuel Efficiency).
 *  Diesel (Vehicle population) * Diesel (Miles Travelled) * Diesel (Fuel Efficiency).
 *  LPG (Vehicle population) * LPG (Miles Travelled) * LPG (Fuel Efficiency).

G denotes all vehicles that use the Fuel Type Gasoline.

D denotes all vehicles that use the Fuel Type Diesel.

L denotes all vehicles that use the Fuel Type LPG.

We will use the most efficient and scalable method.
